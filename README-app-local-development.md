**This feature is enabled in pre-release versions only.**

### Major Features Status

#### Implemented

- Clone SDK app to local workspace
- Deploy any code file up to Make (+bulk deploy)
  - "Deploy all" by clicking on `makecomapp.json`.
- Rewrite the local file with the newer version from Make (pull)
- Compare local code file with Make
- Local app code can be deployed to multiple remote Make apps.
  Useful if different Make app(s) is used for development/testing purposes.
- ApiKey store as local file(s)
  - Handle multiple apiKey files in the same workspace.
- Pull new components from Make
- Compatible with GIT versioning
- Create local components (connections, modules)

#### Waiting for the implementation

- Create local components (webhooks, RPCs, functions).
  - Note: Create with empty files only (or single template only)
- Validate the `makecomapp.json` file by JSON schema on each usage
- Using a single "shared" code file for multiple components. Mention it also in "Tips & Tricks".
- Smart code highlight and JSON validation.
- IMLJSON suggestions (e.g. `parameters`, `connection` object properties)
- Pull all changes from Make (update existing local project by remote changes)
- Wizard, which helps to create all types of components with all templates (same experience as on UI).
- Nice to have: Icon file
- Not tested with published apps, where there is versioning integrated in Make.
  Actions "commit changes" and "discard changes" are not implemented. The user must run these actions on the web UI.
- Correct handling components with autogenerated IDs in case of multiple origins.
  - Possible solution 1: Connection will be defined multiple times, each one with ID for specific origins. All connections are linking to same code files.
  - Possible solution 2: The "alternative ID" must be implemented somehow, becase the component has different ID on each origin and there is no logic relation between these IDs.
- Complete comparison local vs. remote.
- Local testing of Custom Functions
- Create empty folders for components
  - Except functions, which are available for limited users only.
- Ability to navigate from one custom function to another by ctrl-click to function name. (Same feature is on the web UI).

Note: For details see also the extension CHANGELOG.

### How to use SDK app local development

The idea is that a developer can `clone` a whole SDK app from Make to local files. Files are `pulled` to the workspace currently opened in VS Code. From this time all local files are "disconnected" from Make until a developer `deploys` them back to Make. Therefore a developer can work on changes as long as he needs without touching on the SDK app running in Make. When all necessary changes are made locally a developer can `deploy` changes back to Make. The whole SDK app can be `deployed` or any `component` can be deployed anytime separately. There is also a way to `pull` changes made in Make and update the local files in case somebody is touching to SDK app `codes` directly on Make UI or by VS Code Extension online editing.

To be sure, what code is currently in Make, the developer can `Compare with Make` by right-clicking on any local code file. Then the diff window (remote vs. local) will be displayed in VS Code.

### Terms used in local development feature

- `component` - One section of an app. Each component is one of the following types:
                module, connection, RPC, custom function, webhook.
- `code` - Each file (mostly JSON) is named `code` and it is the part `component`
           or it belongs to the app itself directly (like `Base`, `Common` or `README`).
- `clone` - The process, which clones a SDK app from Make into a newly created local directory in your opened workspace.
- `pull` - The process that updates or inserts a local component (or its code) loaded from a remote origin (Make).
- `deploy` - The process, which pushes/uploads a local component or code to remote origin (Make).
- `remote`, `origin`, `Make` - Make.com or similar public cloud Make instance or private Make instance.

### How to clone an app to local files

1. Open the workspace (local directory), where an SDK app should be placed.

   *Note: Monorepo style is supported. It means multiple SDK apps can be placed in the same workspace.*

2. In VS Code's Activity Bar click on the tab `Make apps` to see all your already existing SDK apps.

   *Note: Expected the `Make Apps SDK` VS Code extension to be installed and the environment with ApiKey is already configured.*

3. Use the right mouse to click on any SDK app and select the `Clone to local workspace` context menu item.

   ![Clone menu item](https://github.com/integromat/vscode-apps-sdk/blob/development/resources/readme/localdev/clone-to-local.png?raw=true)

4. The process asks you to select a destination directory. The default is the `src`.

   *Note: If you intend to have multiple apps in a single workspace, each app must be cloned into a different subdirectory.*

5. When the `clone` process is finished VS Code switches the view to File Explorer, where newly pulled files are placed and the app `README` file will be opened.

6. GIT code versioning (optional step):

   1. Create a new git repository in vscode app folder by `git init`.
   2. Add all files and make first commit by `git add -a; git commit -m "init"`

   ... Now your app code is versioned! You can use `git` commands as usual.

   *After this step the local development is ready to use! üëç*

### Local clone structure

When the SDK app is cloned into local files, it is created into some subdirectory (mostly `src`). In this directory, the most important file is `makecomapp.json` which is the main file of the whole project. There is the list of all components, app metadata and links to all component code files. Anytime a new component is created, it must be defined in this `makecomapp.json` file. When a developer right-clicks to this file, he can perform a couple of additional actions for managing/editing/deploying the project local code.

Many actions can be also executed on a sub-part of the project only. For this case, the right-click can be used on any component's subdirectory or on any component code file.

### Deploy local changes to Make

Any part of the SDK app (including all changes) can be deployed back to Make (named as `remote origin`). For this action do a right mouse click to any code file, component directory, whole `src` directory or `makecomapp.json` file. Select the menu item `Deploy to Make` to start updating the SDK app in Make by local code files.

![Context menu actions](https://github.com/integromat/vscode-apps-sdk/blob/development/resources/readme/localdev/context-menu-actions.png?raw=true)

If the component does not exist in Make yet, then the developer sees the info message with confirmation to create a new component in Make.

### Add new components into local files

Because local component creation is not implemented yet, please create a new component online and then pull it into local code as a temporary workaround:

To add a new SDK app `connection` or `module` component into local files there are three possible approaches:

- Assisted component adding
- Manual adding file(s) of new component from scratch
- Online component adding + pull new components

#### Assisted component adding

Right-click on `makecomapps.json` and select `Create [component-type] Component`. In this way, you can add new `modules` or `connections`.

*Note: Adding `custom functions`, `RPCs`, and `webhooks` are not implemented yet (but it will be released soon).*

The alternative way is to right-click on an appropriate directory with the list of components. Example: The directory `connetions` has context menu item `Create Connection Component`. Similarly, the directory `modules` has context menu item `Create Module Component`.

This action creates appropriate code files and defines the new component in `makecomapp.json`.

#### Manual adding file(s) of new component from scratch

**IMPORTANT NOTE: This feature is under development and it is not fully implemented yet.**

You can create new components manually by the same steps as the assisted component adding:

1. Create the new component directory in the same structure as another existing one. The directory structure is `[src]/[componentType]/[componentName]`. Example: `src/modules/get-items`.

2. Create the required code files of the component. Note: Each type of component requires another set of code files. In this step, the easiest way is to copy/paste files from another existing similar component.

3. Add component details and the references to files created in step 2 into the `makecomapp.json` file placed in the component root directory. Again, the easiest way is to copy/paste the structure from another similar existing component.

#### Online component adding + pull new components

1. Create a new app component online (via the online part of VS Code Extension or via "My Apps" in the Make web interface).

2. Right-click over the `makecomapps.json` and click `Pull New Components from Make`.

### Storing ApiKey during local development

In the case of using app local development, the API key is stored in the `[workspaceRoot]/.secrets/apikey` file. When multiple origins or multiple apps are placed in a single workspace there will be multiple files.

Note: Path `.secrets` is automatically added into `.gitignore` to avoid accidentally committing into a GIT repository.

### Multiple remote origins

Each locally developer SDK app is cloned from its remote origin. Origin (Make API URI with the API key) is defined in `makecomapp.json` in the section `origins`. By default, each app has one origin. But this can be extended with an unlimited count of origins by a simple edit of this section `origins`.

From the time you define the second origin (or more), you will be asked by VS Code dialog to choose the origin from the list on each interaction with a remote app in Make (deploy, pull, ...).

![Multiple origins selection dialog](https://github.com/integromat/vscode-apps-sdk/blob/development/resources/readme/localdev/origin-selection.png?raw=true)

The purpose of this feature is to cover the case, where developers have also another SDK app in Make used for the development or testing stage.

**Limitation: Multiple origins works with component types, which have user defined IDs (`modules`, `RPCs`, `functions`). But there is the limitation for  `connections`, `webhooks`, where IDs are autogenerated. Therefore for these autogenerated IDs it is not possible to deploy it into multiple origins, because each origin's compoment set uses absolutely different IDs.**

### GIT usage

The local development feature is fully compatible with GIT. Use `git init` at any time in the workspace.

During the app clone to the local workspace, the `.gitignore` file is created automatically with the following files to exclude from GIT:

- `.secret` directory, because contains the private API key(s).
- `common.js` general code file, because it can contain some secrets or other private data.
- `*.common.js` connection code file, because it can contain some secrets or other private data.
