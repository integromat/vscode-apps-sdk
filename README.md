## July 2024: Introducing the Local Development for Apps

### What is Local Development for Apps?

Local Development for Apps is a game-changing feature that bridges the gap between your local development environment and apps hosted on Make. It empowers developers to work efficiently, iterate faster, and have full control over changes, history, and deployment of applications‚Äîall without disrupting live apps running in production.

### How Does It Work?

1. **Clone and Pull**

   - Developers can effortlessly clone an entire app from Make to their local workspace within Visual Studio Code.

   - Files are pulled from Make, allowing developers to work on their local copies independently.

2. **Local Development Iterations**

   - Once pulled, local files become ‚Äúdisconnected‚Äù from Make. Developers can make changes, and iterate without affecting the live app.

   - No more worries about accidentally breaking the production app while coding!

3. **Deployment to Testing App**

   - Developers have the freedom to work at their own pace. Make necessary changes locally, deploy to testing app absolutely separated from production, and fine-tune without any pressure.

   - Whether it‚Äôs a minor tweak or a major overhaul, the Local Development for Apps has you covered.

4. **Deployment to production app**:

   - When ready, developers can seamlessly deploy their changes back to Make.
Choose to deploy the entire app or specific components individually. Flexibility at its best!

5. **Sync with Make**

   - Worried about changes made directly in Make? No problem!

   - Use the ‚ÄúCompare with Make‚Äù feature by right-clicking on any local code file in VS Code.

   - The diff window displays a clear comparison between the remote code on Make and your local version.

### Why Local Development for Apps?

- **Productivity Boost**: Focus on coding without disrupting the live app.

- **Collaboration Made Easy**: Work alongside teammates while keeping the change history tracked, thanks to GIT versioning.

- **Peace of Mind**: Know exactly what‚Äôs in Make by comparing local and remote code.
Unlock the power of Local Development for Apps today and elevate your development experience. Say goodbye to uncontrolled instant deployment to production and hello to safe innovation! üöÄ
